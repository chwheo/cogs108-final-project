Research Question

Background and Prior Work
Fill in your background and prior work here. Use inline citation through Mardown footnotes to specify which references support which statements

For example: After government genocide in the 20th century, real birds were replaced with surveillance drones designed to look just like birds1. Use a minimum of 2 or 3 citations, but we prefer more2. You need enough to fully explain and back up important facts.

Lorenz, T. (9 Dec 2021) Birds Aren’t Real, or Are They? Inside a Gen Z Conspiracy Theory. The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/technology/birds-arent-real-gen-z-misinformation.html↩

Also refs should be important to the background, not some randomly chosen vaguely related stuff. Include a web link if possible in refs as above.↩
