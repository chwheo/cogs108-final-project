    "Main question: Are characteristics of an individual’s diet (such as the amount of calories, macronutrients, and/or micronutrients) correlated with their likelihood of contracting COVID-19? \n", 
    "\n",
    "Sub-questions: Can we correlate diet type (eg. vegetarian, keto, pescetarian) with an individual’s likelihood of contracting COVID-19? Which characteristic is the strongest predictor? \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential extension: Does correlation between a characteristic necessarily mean causation (eg. If we find that there is a positive correlation between kcal/day and likelihood of contracting COVID-19, does that necessarily mean that a high calorie diet leads to higher vulnerability to COVID-19?)? How much literature is there on databases to support the causal relationship?"

    "With the prevalence of the COVID-19 in recent years, multiple actions are taken to protect people from getting infected and help people recover. One possible action is to eat a healthy diet, since it is commonly heard that eating a healthy diet has multiple benefits, such as lowering risks for multiple common diseases, supporting muscle, and boosting immunity [^1]. According to the World Health Organization, a healthy diet is balanced calorically with energy expenditure; low in saturated fats, trans fats, free sugar, salt; and high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes). [^2]\n",
 
"Multiple studies have shown that there are correlations between certain dietary components and general health. For example, dietary fatty acids are found to have a significant role in immune responses and thus support immunity [^3]; Consuming a good source of protein at least twice a day can help maintaining strong respiratory muscles [^4], and high levels of certain vegetables are essential for sustaining intestinal immune function [^5]. However, these findings do not directly address whether there’s a correlation between certain dietary components and COVID-19.\n",
 
"There are existing efforts to study healthy eating as a non-pharmaceutical intervention for COVID-19 [^6]. A dataset that details the typical characteristics of a country’s diet, as well as its obesity and COVID-19 rates, has been compiled. It is based on findings from organizations such as the UN and Johns Hopkins university. Potential concerns with the data include accuracy, inconsistencies in units, and collection from different years (which could make comparisons unfair). Notable conclusions from analysis so far include that \"COVID-19 confirmed percentage is less in the countries where Animal Product Protein consumption is low like India\", \"countries where obesity is low COVID-19 cases are low\", and \"​​ The countries with the most recovered rate seem to consume more vegetables than people on average\".\n",
"\n",
 
"It is worth noting that existing analysis on the dataset is incomplete, scattered, and presented in a confusing way (eg. relevant information like vegetable consumptions vs recovery rate is mixed in with irrelevant information like vegetable consumption vs alcohol consumption). There also  seems to be a stronger emphasis on establishing the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 rates rather than diet and COVID-19 rates.\n",
